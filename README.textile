h1. Why you should be interested in ace?

In Ace, every page is an instance
Typically I want to define methods, like @post.excerpt

There are also *generators* available for easier generating items on the fly.

Ace has *template inheritance*. I love template inheritance, it's more flexible pattern than layouts.

Tasks for deployment included.

h1. The boot process

# load @boot.rb@ where the
# load the rules (controllers / globs mapping)
# load & instantiate the items: only the renderables (concrete post)
# run the filters, layoutin' ... actually this can be defined in the controller
# match the routes, write the files
