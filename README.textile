Ace is a static page generator like "Nanoc":http://nanoc.stoneship.org, "Jekyll":https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll or "Webby":http://webby.rubyforge.org/tutorial. How is it different? Well, it's better :) ! I really like Nanoc and I used it for quite a while, but it's not flexible enough. If you need to generate a lot of pages on the fly, it's a hassle. It provides helpers, but helpers are – let's face it – programming style we used to use years back when we yet believed that PHP is actually a really nice language.

Also, last but not least, Ace has a real template inheritance. Layouts are for kids, real men use template inheritance! What's the advantage? It's incredibly flexible.
